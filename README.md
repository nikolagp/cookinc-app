# What I have learned

With this project I have learned the fundamentals of React and the basic React ecosystem for creating app. I practiced navigation with React Router, maniputaled data with useState and useEffect where I used them in almost each component. Among other things, I used Spoonacular API as part of the web APIs. For the need of the project, I become familiar with fetching data and rendering it in the browser using the advantage.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

Most challenging part was routing among the components and sometimes I faced challenges with the props. But a with the help of YouTube and React documentation I become comfortabe working with it by the end of this project.

# Source

I was inspired from the React course by Developed By Ed, from his YouTube channel.
